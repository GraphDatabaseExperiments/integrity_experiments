# Integrity Managament in Graph Databases using E/R keys

## Introduction: 

This Github repository complements our research on integrity management in graph databases using E/R keys.

In particular, this repository is comprised of the following:

- experiment results on the TPC-H benchamrk
- compilations that outline how experiments have been conducted
- images illustrating the experiments on graph datasets
- files and instructions on how to replicate experiments and shwoing their results

## Preliminaries:

The software used to perform the experiments carried out in our research are:

- Neo4j Desktop 1.5.0

- Neo4j Browser 5.0.0


The TPC-H benchmark is provided on the official [TPC website](https://www.tpc.org/tpch/). 


## Experiments:

The experiments in our research on E/R keys are outlined in the following:

- 1.) [How can E/R keys improve entity integrity management?](https://github.com/GraphDatabaseExperiments/integrity_experiments/tree/main/entity_integrity)
- 2.) [How can E/R keys improve referential integrity management?](https://github.com/GraphDatabaseExperiments/integrity_experiments/tree/main/referential_integrity)


Detailed information on the results of these experiments and instructions on how to replicate them can be found in this repository in the experiments folder or by clicking on the links above. In what follows we like to provide an overview on the different experiments.
